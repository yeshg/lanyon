    <p>The <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">Deep Learning Specialization</a> on Coursera is one of the most popular online resources for learning machine learning. After following Andrej Karpathy’s CS231n (another popular course for learning machine learning) and self-studying deep learning from a variety of research papers and websites, I think that Andrew Ng’s Coursera specialization is the most comprehensive and structured way to become a deep learning expert without going to a university. The purpose of the following posts is to summarize the key points of the specialization as an extended guide/cheatsheet for deep learning.</p>

The [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) on Coursera is one of the most popular online resources for learning machine learning. After following Andrej Karpathy's CS231n (another popular course for learning machine learning) and self-studying deep learning from a variety of research papers and websites, I think that Andrew Ng's Coursera specialization is the most comprehensive and structured way to become a deep learning expert without going to a university. The purpose of the following posts is to summarize the key points of the specialization as an extended guide/cheatsheet for deep learning.

I hope these posts will be useful for both those who find this website, and for my own deep learning projects.
